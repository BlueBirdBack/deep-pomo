# DeepPomo

A lightweight web app designed to boost productivity using the Pomodoro technique. Built with Next.js (React) for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS, powered by a FastAPI (Python) backend, and using PostgreSQL for storage. This MVP focuses on core functionality:

- **Task Creation & Management:** Create tasks and break them into sub-tasks for hierarchical drill-down (e.g., Task 2 → 2.4 → 2.4.1…).
- **Flexible Navigation:** Supports hierarchical navigation, offering options like breadcrumb-style navigation or other alternatives, ensuring users can easily track and revisit their work.
- **Decoupled Pomodoro Timers:** Pomodoro timers operate independently from tasks—accommodating scenarios where a task requires multiple Pomodoros or one Pomodoro relates to multiple tasks.
- **Visual History:** Features a color-coded visual history to indicate previously worked-on tasks, enhancing user clarity and navigation.

This repository prioritizes an MVP development approach, laying the foundation for future enhancements and refinements.
